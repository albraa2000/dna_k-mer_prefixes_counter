k-mer counting is an important step in many bioinformatics applications that are used to analyze sequencing data. Recently, several tools and techniques have been developed to count the frequency of k-length substrings (k-mers) in reads generated from high-throughput sequencing [1]. k-mer counting involves counting the number of substrings that have length k in a string S, or a set of strings, where k is a positive integer.
